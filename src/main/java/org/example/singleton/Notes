🛠️ Step-by-Step Plan to Learn Singleton Coding
Step 1 → Create a basic Singleton (eager initialization)
👉 Learn why we make constructor private and how to test it.

Step 2 → Convert it to lazy initialization
👉 Show the problem in multithreading.

Step 3 → Fix it with synchronized method
👉 Then show performance issue.

Step 4 → Optimize with double-checked locking + volatile
👉 Learn why volatile is required.

Step 5 → Use Bill Pugh Singleton (inner static helper class)
👉 Interview favorite: best practice for lazy init.

Step 6 → Create Enum Singleton
👉 Show why it’s safest (prevents reflection, serialization issues).

Step 7 → Show how Singleton breaks

Reflection

Deserialization

Cloning

Multithreading

Step 8 → Fix each breaking method one by one.

Step 9 → Mini-project using Singleton
👉 Example: ConfigManager, Logger, or DBManager.


🔹 Do We Always Need instance and getInstance() in Singleton?
1️⃣ The instance field
Yes ✅ we need an instance variable because the whole point of Singleton is:

Only one object exists, and we store it somewhere.

If you don’t store the instance, each caller might create their own new object → Singleton breaks.

2️⃣ The getInstance() method
This is the global access point.

Without it, there’s no standard way to get the one object (since constructor is private).

Instead of getInstance(), you could expose a public static final field directly, but that’s not


📝 Interview-Ready Explanation
Q: Do we always need a getInstance() method in Singleton?

A:
The getInstance() method is the most common way because it provides a single global access point.
Technically, we can also expose a public static final instance directly, but that reduces flexibility.
For example, if tomorrow we want lazy loading or add thread-safety logic, we’d have to change the design.

So, best practice is to keep the instance private and provide access via getInstance().

📝 Interview Explanation
Q: Can you give a real example of Singleton usage in production code?

A: Sure. In one project, we implemented a Logger Singleton.
Our application had multiple layers like Service and Repository. Instead of each class creating its own logger, they all used the same Singleton Logger. This ensured consistent log formatting and prevented file locking issues when writing logs.

For example, UserService and UserRepository both used the Singleton Logger to log debug, info, and error messages.
